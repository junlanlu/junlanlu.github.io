I am a machine learning research scientist at Meta working on ads recommendation models.

I obtained my PhD in medical physics at Duke University, advised by [Prof. Bastiaan Driehuys](https://sites.duke.edu/driehuyslab/). There, I developed imaging processing methods for hyperpolarized Xenon MRI.

Previously, I earned my B.S. in engineering physics at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Gennady Shvets](https://shvets.aep.cornell.edu/). My thesis topic was on metasurfaced-enhanced FTIR for tissue characterization.

In my free time, I like to play basketball and collect Pokemon cards.
