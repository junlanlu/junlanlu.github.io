I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the medical physics graduate program at Duke University, advised by [Prof. Bastiaan Driehuys](https://sites.duke.edu/driehuyslab/). Here, I develop imaging processing methods for hyperpolarized Xenon MRI. My research interests are broadly in medical image processing, reconstruction, and analysis. I am also interested in deep learning and computer vision, and have experience with image generation, segmentation, and super-resolution.

Previously, I earned my B.S. in engineering physics at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Gennady Shvets](https://shvets.aep.cornell.edu/). My thesis topic was on metasurfaced-enhanced FTIR for tissue characterization.

In my free time, I like to play basketball and collect Pokemon cards.
