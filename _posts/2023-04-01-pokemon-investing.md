I grew up in the era of Pokémon, and as a kid, I was absolutely captivated by it. From playing the Pokémon games on my DS to opening up Pokémon cards at my local card shop, Pokémon was a huge part of my life. As I got older, I kept my love for Pokémon, and it eventually led me to start investing in Pokémon cards.

## Why Pokémon is a Decent Investment

The Pokémon franchise has been around for more than 25 years, and it's still going strong. The brand has a massive, loyal fan base that spans multiple generations. The scarcity and demand for certain rare cards have resulted in their value appreciating over time. With a stable fan base, nostalgia, and limited supply, it makes sense that the prices of rare cards and items would increase. More specifically, sealed booster boxes, have a unique appeal to collectors and investors due to their rarity and the potential for valuable cards inside. As these boxes become harder to find over time (they're either opened or destroyed), their scarcity increases, driving up their value. Moreover, the unopened boxes retain an air of mystery, with collectors speculating about the possibility of finding rare or highly sought-after cards within. Also, many people who grew up with Pokémon have fond memories of opening packs, and the desire to relive those moments can create additional demand for sealed product. I see it as investing in slot machines because you know people will want to gamble.

## What I am collecting

I am collecting sealed WOTC and EX booster boxes. Booster boxes, unlike many other sealed products, don't take up much space, but contain a lot of value inside. They're a bit more liquid than individual PSA slabs, making them easier to sell later on. There's also a healthy market of collectors, investors, and box-breakers.
