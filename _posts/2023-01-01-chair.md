Oh, how proud I felt when I first flipped a Herman Miller Aeron chair. It was a great feeling of accomplishment to have discovered a market inefficiency. As a PhD student at the time, I never thought I'd find myself making money from office furniture, but there's something about the sleek lines and ergonomic design of the Aeron chair that just speaks to my inner nerd.

My first flip was a bit of a disaster. I had found a beaten-up Aeron chair on Craigslist for a steal, and I thought I could spruce it up and sell it for a profit. But as soon as I got it home and started inspecting it, I realized I was in over my head. The mesh seat was torn, the armrests were wobbly, and the frame was scuffed and scratched beyond repair. I felt like I had bitten off more than I could chew.

But being the stubborn nerd that I am, I refused to give up. I spent hours scouring YouTube tutorials and forums, learning everything I could about how to refurbish an Aeron chair. I ordered replacement parts online, sanded and polished the frame, and even taught myself how to reweave the mesh seat. It was a labor of love, but when I finally finished, I was amazed at how good it looked.

When I posted the chair on Craigslist, I didn't have high expectations. I figured I'd get a few lowball offers, and maybe sell it for enough to cover my costs. But to my surprise, the chair sold within hours of posting it. And not only did it sell, but I got multiple offers above my asking price. I couldn't believe it. I had created something valuable out of nothing, and people were willing to pay good money for it.

That first flip was a turning point for me. It gave me the confidence to keep going, to keep searching for beat-up Aeron chairs and turning them into something beautiful. And with each flip, I felt a sense of satisfaction that can only come from taking something that was discarded or undervalued, and turning it into something that people truly appreciate.

Of course, not every flip was a success. There were plenty of chairs that I spent hours working on, only to find that nobody wanted to buy them. And there were times when I questioned whether all the time and effort I was putting into these chairs was really worth it.

But looking back on those days, I realize that the sense of pride and accomplishment I felt from flipping those chairs was about more than just the money. It was about taking control of my own destiny, about creating something of value out of nothing, and about proving to myself that I was capable of doing something outside of my academic comfort zone.

So yes, I may be a physics PhD student, but I'm also a furniture flipping master. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
