I recently decided to channel this passion into creating a web application called <a href="https://collegeshunt.com">collegeshunt.com</a>, which aims to help folks find the most prestigious colleges based on their preferences.</p>

<h2 id="my-thoughts-on-prestige">My thoughts on prestige</h2>

<p>In my perspective, the concept of prestige in higher education should be approached with a balanced mindset that acknowledges its importance while remaining grounded in reality. Prestige is undeniably intertwined with academic reputation, alumni networks, and the overall educational experience, yet it remains a multifaceted and often subjective notion. As an advocate for well-rounded decision-making, I believe prestige can provide valuable insights but should not overshadow other crucial factors such as personal values, academic interests, and individual aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>

<p>The idea was born from <a href="https://prestigehunt.com">prestigehunt.com</a>, a website that ranks companies by prestige. In fact, I ripped off most of their front-end.</p>

<p>This could also be applied to institutions of higher education, as traditional rankings often don’t provide the complete picture, and there’s a need for a more dynamic and community-driven platform. With this website, users can contribute to the rankings by participating in head-to-head (H2H) prestige matches, creating a more accurate and constantly evolving list of top colleges. Plus, I think it would be funny to see the results.</p>

<h2 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack</h2>

<p>I built a single-page application using React for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. React’s component-based architecture and Firebase’s real-time database capabilities made it an excellent choice for creating a responsive and interactive user experience.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-solutions">Challenges and Solutions</h2>

<p>One of the main challenges I encountered during development was that I did not know much about web development. I knew almost nothing about React, Node.js, and databases. I had to figure out how to build this damn thing in the shortest time possible. Conveniently, I generally knew from the front-end what was required of the back-end. The challenge was to figure out how to properly structure the back-end code to fulfill the requests of the front-end client.</p>

<p>To overcome these challenges, I used <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Github Copilot</a>. It saved me a TON of time. Since I knew how the backend should generally behave (and it wasn’t super complicated), they got about 90 percent of the code correct. Being a complete noob, I also wasn’t aware that Firestore had a limit of 500 actions (read, write, or delete operations) per transaction. This limitation posed a challenge when scaling my application to handle hundreds of head-to-head matches. It required me to use batched writes instead.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Building this website has been an incredibly rewarding experience, as I’ve learned a lot about React, Firebase, and ChatGPT prompting. Finally, don’t take the rankings too seriously.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="projects" /><category term="projects" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[building a web-app to rank colleges]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">investing in pokémon sealed product</title><link href="https://junlanlu.github.io/posts/2023/pokemon-investing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="investing in pokémon sealed product" /><published>2023-04-20T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-20T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://junlanlu.github.io/posts/2023/pokemon-investing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://junlanlu.github.io/posts/2023/pokemon-investing/"><![CDATA[<p>I grew up in the era of Pokémon, and as a kid, I was absolutely captivated by it. From playing the Pokémon games on my DS to opening up Pokémon cards at my local card shop, Pokémon was a huge part of my life. As I got older, I kept my love for Pokémon, and it eventually led me to start investing in Pokémon cards.</p>

<h2 id="why-pokémon-is-a-decent-investment">Why Pokémon is a Decent Investment</h2>

<p>The Pokémon franchise has been around for more than 25 years, and it’s still going strong. The brand has a massive, loyal fan base that spans multiple generations. The scarcity and demand for certain rare cards have resulted in their value appreciating over time. With a stable fan base, nostalgia, and limited supply, it makes sense that the prices of rare cards and items would increase. More specifically, sealed booster boxes, have a unique appeal to collectors and investors due to their rarity and the potential for valuable cards inside. As these boxes become harder to find over time (they’re either opened or destroyed), their scarcity increases, driving up their value. Moreover, the unopened boxes retain an air of mystery, with collectors speculating about the possibility of finding rare or highly sought-after cards within. Also, many people who grew up with Pokémon have fond memories of opening packs, and the desire to relive those moments can create additional demand for sealed product. I see it as investing in slot machines because you know people will want to gamble.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-am-collecting">What I am collecting</h2>

<p>I am collecting sealed WOTC and EX booster boxes. Booster boxes, unlike many other sealed products, don’t take up much space, but contain a lot of value inside. They’re a bit more liquid than individual PSA slabs, making them easier to sell later on. There’s also a healthy market of collectors, investors, and box-breakers.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="fun" /><category term="fun" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[investing in Pokémon cards]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">keeping track of online resources</title><link href="https://junlanlu.github.io/posts/2023/resources/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="keeping track of online resources" /><published>2023-04-20T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-20T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://junlanlu.github.io/posts/2023/resources</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://junlanlu.github.io/posts/2023/resources/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="my-resources">My resources</h1>

It was a great feeling of accomplishment to have discovered a market inefficiency. As a PhD student at the time, I never thought I’d find myself making money from office furniture, but there’s something about the sleek lines and ergonomic design of the Aeron chair that just speaks to my inner nerd.</p>

<p>My first flip was a bit of a disaster. I had found a beaten-up Aeron chair on Craigslist for a steal, and I thought I could spruce it up and sell it for a profit. But as soon as I got it home and started inspecting it, I realized I was in over my head. The mesh seat was torn, the armrests were wobbly, and the frame was scuffed and scratched beyond repair. I felt like I had bitten off more than I could chew.</p>

<p>But being the stubborn nerd that I am, I refused to give up. I spent hours scouring YouTube tutorials and forums, learning everything I could about how to refurbish an Aeron chair. I ordered replacement parts online, sanded and polished the frame, and even taught myself how to reweave the mesh seat. It was a labor of love, but when I finally finished, I was amazed at how good it looked.</p>

<p>When I posted the chair on Craigslist, I didn’t have high expectations. I figured I’d get a few lowball offers, and maybe sell it for enough to cover my costs. But to my surprise, the chair sold within hours of posting it. And not only did it sell, but I got multiple offers above my asking price. I couldn’t believe it. I had created something valuable out of nothing, and people were willing to pay good money for it.</p>

<p>That first flip was a turning point for me. It gave me the confidence to keep going, to keep searching for beat-up Aeron chairs and turning them into something beautiful. And with each flip, I felt a sense of satisfaction that can only come from taking something that was discarded or undervalued, and turning it into something that people truly appreciate.</p>

<p>Of course, not every flip was a success. There were plenty of chairs that I spent hours working on, only to find that nobody wanted to buy them. And there were times when I questioned whether all the time and effort I was putting into these chairs was really worth it.</p>

<p>But looking back on those days, I realize that the sense of pride and accomplishment I felt from flipping those chairs was about more than just the money. It was about taking control of my own destiny, about creating something of value out of nothing, and about proving to myself that I was capable of doing something outside of my academic comfort zone.</p>

<p>So yes, I may be a physics PhD student, but I’m also a furniture flipping master. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="fun" /><category term="fun" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[who knew flipping herman miller chairs could be so profitable]]></summary></entry></feed>
